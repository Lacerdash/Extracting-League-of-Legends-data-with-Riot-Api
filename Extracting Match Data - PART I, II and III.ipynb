    "\n",
    "I play League since season 4 and I´ve always been a fan of the game. Recently I have started studying Data Science and the analyst sector in esports, manly in LOL. And one day when I was trying to figure out a good project to my portifolio I came acroos a idea of using league of legends match data to make exploratory analysis, data visualization and ML. \n",
    "\n",
    "So why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then, I have been looking where could I find LOL match data to use in my project. I even found some places with data sources available, but I decided to \"create\" my own data source, to my project be even more unique. After I decided this, I started studying about RIOT API to understand how could I use it to create my DataFrame. When I was able to figure out how I could do this using python + RIOT API, I immediately though about creating this guide to help others that might be in the same situation that I was."
